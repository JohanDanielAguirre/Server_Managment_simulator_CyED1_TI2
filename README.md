# Server_Managment_simulator_CyED1_TI2

In 2023 there’s been a dire need for services that enable companies to quickly know the speeds and routes their servers provide for better use of their immediate resources. Rather than having to manually check every server they would rather set them up in a simulated environment with their respective connection information to quickly learn the fastest route between servers for stability and efficiency. For this problem our company aims to develop a simulated environment that mimics the respective server connections for companies to input their networks to and micromanage their resources.

The system needs a javafx interface with an always showing diagram of all servers and server connections. Must have a add server button which includes name of server, and IP address. Must have a add connection button which links servers through the IP’s.

## Aclaration: 
The tests on the JavaFX don't work as intented. It throws an Error calles IllegalAccesError, we tried to fixed it doesn't work no matter what. So we decided to create to projects, one with the unit tests and the other with the javaFX project.
